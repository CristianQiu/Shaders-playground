# About
This is a Unity project showcasing clouds volume rendering with raymarching, and a simple coloured wave.
The cloud volume rendering uses raymarching and several octaves of 3D noise per step march (computed each frame), so expect it to be very slow if you do not have a high end GPU.
The wave is pretty simple and was just a way for me to practice with matrices.
