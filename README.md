# About
This is a Unity project showcasing cloud volume rendering and a simple coloured wave.
The cloud volume rendering uses raymarching and several octaves of 3D noise (computed each frame), so expect it to be very slow if you do not have a high end GPU.
The wave is pretty simple and was just a way for me of practicing with matrices.
